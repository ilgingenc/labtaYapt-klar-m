First question: Because CPU time depends on the computer,and complier.It can change every time.So we use time complexity(Big O) to compare algorithms.
Second Question:This code does only few steps -always the same number.So it is O(1)- constnat time.
Third Question: a-)Runs n times->O(n)    b-)Two loops->n*n=O(n**2)    c->Divised by 2 each time->O(logn)
